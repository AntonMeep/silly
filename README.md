silly
=====

**silly** is a no-nonsense test runner for the D programming language. Instead of re-inventing the wheel and adding more and more levels of abstraction it just works, requiring as little effort from the programmer as possible.

## Installation

Just add **silly** as a dependency of your project and that's it.

## Advanced configuration

There's `debug` configuration that can be used to show additional information during compilation.
